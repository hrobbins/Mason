@hmason: I need a plugin that can highlight people's names on a web page if I've e-mailed/tweeted with them before. #hacktobe

What you see here is a basic proof-of-concept.

1. Downloading mason.crx in Chrome should install.
    - alternatively, you can download the project and load it as an unpacked extension in dev mode
2. One installed, it should pop-up a window/tab for Oauth to the Google contact data feed
3. Once you've granted access, it will load your contects every time the browser is started.

Any page you see from there on out will give any names from your contact list a hideous yellow highlight.
For a good test is to go to Linked-In, or Facebook.

Potential Improvements:
    * Add Twitter, etc
    * Change how names are highlighted.
    * On MouseOver: Show user avatar thumbnails.
    * OnClick Jump to the user profile, or an inbox search for that contact to refresh your memory.
